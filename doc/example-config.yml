roles:
    # This section allows specifying roles that we would like this daemon to perform.
    # For example, let's have a client agent which listens on port 6667 on all interfaces:
    - type: clientagent
      bind: 0.0.0.0:6667

    # Next we'll have a state server, whose control channel is 402000.
    - type: stateserver
      control: 402000

    # Now a database, which listens on channel 402001, generates objects with ids >= 100,000,000+ and
    # uses BerkeleyDB as a backing store.
    - type: database
      control: 402001
      generate:
      # Generate defines the range of DistributedObject ids that the database can create new objects with,
      # and is generally responsible for. Min and max are both optional fields.
        min: 100000000 # Required (no default)
      # max: 200000000 # Default: DOID_T_MAX (UINT_MAX)
      engine:
        type: bdb
        filename: main_database.db

    # We will then create a database state server which provides state-server-like behavior on database
    # objects.  The dbss does not have a control channel, and so cannot generate new objects.
    - type: dbss
      database: 402001 # The channel of the associated database
      ranges:
      # Ranges defines a sequence of ranges of DistributedObject ids that the database-state server
      # will provide stateserver-like behavior for.
      # Note: The ranges do not have to match that of the database. This allows for multiple dbss to
      #       split up the handling of a single database. Additionally, it can be used to exclude
      #       special-case or prepopulated objects from recieving SS behavior.
      # Warning: While this is currently allowed by the protocol, if the range of non-prepopulated
      #          object ids are incompletely-covered by DBSS or covered by multiple, erroneous
      #          behavior will occur.
      #          It is recommended to use seperate database roles for DBSS and non-DBSS objects.

    # Let's also enable the Event Logger. The Event Logger does not listen on a channel; it uses a
    # separate UDP socket to listen for log events.
